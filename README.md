# FoodX-251 Classification

This repository contains the code and resources for the FoodX-251 project, which aims to design, implement, and evaluate a system or app using the FoodX-251 dataset. The project focuses on fine-grained food classification and includes several components for classification, retrieval, evaluation, and visual analysis.

## Project Description

The project is based on the FoodX-251 dataset [paper], and the team is required to develop an original project using the entire dataset or a subset of it. The choice of the subset must be justified. The main components of the project include:

1. Classification of the validation set into the 251 classes defined in the dataset (fine-grained food classification).
2. Classification of the degraded validation set into the 251 classes defined in the dataset (fine-grained food classification).
3. Similarity retrieval (category search) of a query image.
4. Objective evaluation of the classification and retrieval results.
5. Visual analysis of significant cases.
6. Objective comparison of different strategies attempted to achieve the final solution.

## Repository Directories

- Data Cleaning: This directory contains scripts and resources related to data cleaning and preprocessing.
- annot: This directory stores annotations or additional data for the dataset.
- notebooks: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for experimentation and analysis.

## Notes

- The primary goal is to achieve the highest possible classification performance on the degraded validation set.
- It is expected that there will be a significant drop in classification accuracy when transitioning from the validation set to the degraded validation set.
